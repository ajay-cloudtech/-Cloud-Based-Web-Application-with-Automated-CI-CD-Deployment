## Project Overview
This project is a cloud-native web application deployed on AWS EC2, designed with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. The pipeline integrates SonarQube for static code analysis, automated builds, and seamless deployments, ensuring high code quality and security.

## Tech Stack
* Frontend: React (JavaScript), HTML, CSS
* Backend: Flask (Python)
* Database: MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL)
* Authentication: Firebase Authentication
* CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Webhooks
* Code Quality & Security: SonarQube
* Server & Deployment: AWS EC2, Gunicorn, Nginx
* Networking & Security: HTTPS (Certbot SSL), CSRF protection, CORS policies

## CI/CD Workflow
* Code Push to GitHub â†’ Triggers Jenkins
* Jenkins Pipeline begins execution
* Fetch latest code
* Run SonarQube static analysis
* Build frontend assets
* Move frontend build to backend
* Install dependencies & set up virtual environment
* Restart application on AWS EC2
* Deployment with Gunicorn & Nginx

## Challenges Faced
Jenkins Permissions: EC2 required additional permission configurations for smooth pipeline execution.
SonarQube Optimization: Initial scans included unnecessary files, slowing down pipeline execution.
Security Considerations: CSRF protection needed to be properly configured without breaking API requests.
HTTPS & SSL Setup: Required setting up a custom domain, Certbot SSL, and Nginx to enforce secure communication.

## Key Learnings
CI/CD automation reduces deployment errors and speeds up software releases.
Static code analysis helps catch vulnerabilities early, improving security.
Nginx as a reverse proxy ensures seamless handling of HTTPS traffic and improves application stability.
Cloud-based authentication with Firebase simplifies user management while maintaining security best practices.
AWS EC2 Elastic IP ensures high availability, preventing disruptions during instance restarts.

## Future Enhancements
Migrate to AWS Cognito for authentication for better security.
Implement AWS CodeDeploy for streamlined CI/CD instead of Jenkins.
Introduce automated testing in the pipeline to catch issues earlier.
Optimize API security further by enforcing strict CORS policies and API gateway integration.
